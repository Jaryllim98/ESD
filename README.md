# What we do

SUTD Greenprint is an environmental club. We strive to promote a sustainable lifestyle and generate awareness on the environmental issues the world faces today. We believe that everyone can do their part, big or small to curtail and reverse the damage done on the environment. Something as simple as cutting down on the usage of one-time use plastic, such as straws, can go a long way in alleviating the plight of our Planet Earth.<br>

# Current Projects


Our efforts are targeted towards inculcating in others, a sustainable lifestyle by providing a platform to kickstart their green habits and make it easier for them to do so. Through our actions, we envision a change in people's mindset and hope that everyone can make green actions a part of their lives.

## Pillar Dialogue 

We aim to have this as a termly event.

**Aim: To provide an avenue for the sharing of important updates and address questions and concerns**

**Format:**

* Pre-survey of Key Topics
* Pre-survey of burning questions/concerns
* Pillar Dialogue (open invite of ESD population)
* Post-email of minutes and key points to the population

## Course Planner

We aim to ease the planning process for students and admin staff regarding to the ever more complicating course/track/minor requirements.
<br><br>

**Currently stable version of the planner is available [here](https://course-planner.opensutd.org/)**

The current version is reactive<br>
In future development, we would also like to make a recommendation system for course-plan/module given student's strength or interest.

** This is a constant process of updating and maintaining the planner, and we seek interested people to join this open source project. Please email ```zhi_zhou@mymail.sutd.edu.sg``` if interested.
