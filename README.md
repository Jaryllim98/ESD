# What we do

SUTD Greenprint is an environmental club. We strive to promote a sustainable lifestyle and generate awareness on the environmental issues the world faces today. We believe that everyone can do their part, big or small to curtail and reverse the damage done on the environment. Something as simple as cutting down on the usage of one-time use plastic, such as straws, can go a long way in alleviating the plight of our Planet Earth.<br>

# Current Projects


Our efforts are targeted towards inculcating in others, a sustainable lifestyle by providing a platform to kickstart their green habits and make it easier for them to do so. Through our actions, we envision a change in people's mindset and hope that everyone can make green actions a part of their lives.

## Scrapyard 



**Aim: To create a space for students to recycle and reuse material from projects. It is located just outside the Fab Lab (nearer to the hostel side)**

**Why you should visit the Scrapyard:**

* Materials such as plywood, acrylic, even metal
* Spare electronic parts and components
* Saves you money and time to buy new parts
* You save the earth

## Community Garden

**Aim: To inculcate a culture of gardening and self-sufficiency. Also, we hope to create a space for all to bond and chill in the vicnity of a relaxing and picturesque space.**

We are currently engaged in a research project to build, maintain, and improve the garden. We are in the process of learning how to grow a variety of different edible crops. 

*We have used several crops for our monthly steamboat session.*
